## Image Processing Steps

- **Convert to Grayscale**: First, the images were converted into grayscale to obtain high-quality grayscale images.
  
- **Apply Random Contrast**: Then, a random contrast function was applied within a predefined contrast factor range to reduce contrast.

- **Add Gaussian Noise and Blur**: Gaussian noise and blur were further added to decrease image brightness, thereby generating the corresponding low-quality grayscale image.
